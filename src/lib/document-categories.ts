/**
 * Clause text for the non-trade categories: mutual NDA, services agreement,
 * commercial agency and commercial lease.
 *
 * Kept apart from document-engine.ts, which holds the trade and maritime
 * clauses, so each file stays readable. The engine decides which clauses a
 * given category uses and in what order; this file only supplies wording,
 * one complete table per locale. The three language versions say the same
 * thing clause for clause.
 *
 * Drafting notes that shape the text:
 *  - Agency: GCC commercial agency statutes are mandatory (registration,
 *    termination and compensation), so the draft yields to them expressly.
 *  - Lease: tenancy law of the place where the premises are is mandatory;
 *    renewal and rent increases are expressed as subject to it.
 *  - IP in services: only ECONOMIC rights are assigned, "to the extent
 *    assignable" -- moral rights are inalienable in the civil-law systems
 *    of the region.
